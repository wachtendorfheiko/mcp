Tyranitar is a Rock/Dark-type Pokémon known for its intimidating appearance and formidable stats. It has a muscular, reptilian body with a jagged, toothed mouth and a powerful build. While it's a strong fighter, its rocky and dark typing make it vulnerable to Water, Electric, and Fighting moves. Many fans dislike it for its lack of appeal compared to other Pokémon, though it's a solid choice in battles.
